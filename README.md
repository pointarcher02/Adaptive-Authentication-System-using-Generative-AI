# Adaptive-Authentication-System-using-Generative-AI for Real Time User Behaviour


The Adaptive Authentication System is an advanced user authentication solution that leverages user behavior data, such as typing speed, mouse movement, and geographic location, to evaluate and authenticate users. This project integrates a robust FastAPI backend with a dynamic front-end interface, providing a secure and user-friendly platform for anomaly detection and authentication.

## Key Features

- **Behavioral Anomaly Detection**: Utilizes complex algorithms to analyze user behaviors in real-time to detect anomalies.
- **Dynamic Response System**: Provides detailed explanations and actionable next steps when anomalies are detected.
- **Interactive User Interface**: A clean and responsive web interface that allows users to input behavior data and receive instant feedback.
- **Comprehensive API**: Built with FastAPI, the system offers a scalable and efficient backend architecture that can handle extensive requests and complex data processing.
